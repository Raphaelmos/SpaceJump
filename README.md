# SpaceJump
A platformer game in Godot reproducing the concept of doodle jump but in space using Godot Visual Scripting.


# Space Jump Alpha

What is this game ? 

A astronaut moving in space with his own gravity platform to platform.

### Characteristics

A vertical 2D game built under Godot using the VisualScripting.VS only and its various tools such as nodes, the camera following the character and the many platforms in the game.

Space Jump Alpha is therefore composed of two scripts, one for the main node called Main composed of a physics process function with conditions and instance function calls connect to the player’s position to determine 
limits to the scene, to stay in the game area 
and start again if the astronaut falls.

The second Main child node script is 
composed of the player with the functions of 
movements (jump and actions left and 
on the right), gravity and variables for the 
gravity, speed, jumping speed and 
function calls.
